One or more weekly recurring lessons

Default price (or special price per student)

Validity window (valid_from / valid_until)

Notes for internal communication

Flags (high-risk student, requires senior instructor, etc.)

Supports:
Multiple services per week for same student

Ad-hoc slot overrides

Instructor replacement

Long-term template changes (“from next week onward”)

Undo safety mechanism

2.2 Lesson Instances (Actual Scheduled Occurrences)
Every instance is created from either:

Weekly template

One-time booking

Manual reschedule

Migration script (edge cases)

Fields:
template_id (nullable)

student_id

instructor_id

service_id

datetime_start

duration_minutes

status (scheduled / completed / cancelled_student / cancelled_clinic / no_show)

metadata

Hard Requirements:
Must NOT be overwritten automatically by weekly generation

Must support “one-time lesson at a slot normally occupied by cancelled regular student”

Must allow manual edits with audit trail

Must surface conflicts (“student has two lessons at the same time”)

3. Weekly Generation Engine
3.1 Default behavior (Automated)
Runs weekly (recommended Sunday 03:00)

Creates 14 days ahead

Does NOT overwrite existing instances

Skips dates marked as “cancelled for this student”

Applies template changes only into the future

Includes safety “dry-run” mode for debugging

Performs conflict detection

3.2 Manual Generation
“Generate week” button

Compares before/after

Shows diff to admin before applying

3.3 Undo
Full rollback available for X minutes

Logged in audit trail

4. Cancellations, No-shows & Reminders
4.1 WhatsApp Bot
Sends reminder at customizable time

Supports bi-directional reply:

“I’m coming”

“I’m not coming”

Updates status on Lesson Instance

Calculates whether cancellation should be charged

4.2 Charging Logic (Set per organization)
Cancellation fee rules

HMO rules:

Clalit: Parent pays 45 ₪, rest from HMO

Meuhedet: Form 17, HMO payment

Leumit: Full pay + reimbursement

Emergency medical note (up to 3 per year)

7. Commitments & Consumption
7.1 Commitments (Pre-paid packages, HMO quotas)
Fields:

student_id

service_id

total_amount (₪)

created_at

expires_at (optional)

metadata

Model note:

Commitments remain package/HMO allocation records for audit and reporting,
while system-wide operational balance is computed at query-time (money-first) from base ledger data.

7.2 Consumption
For each completed lesson:

lesson_instance_id

amount_charged

student_balance_after_charge (computed at query-time from commitments and consumption_entries, including transfer-linked rows)

7.3 Balance Transfers (System-wide)
For family and admin financial operations:

Represented via existing ledger tables:

- One `commitments` row for the target student (adds balance)
- One `consumption_entries` row for the source student (reduces balance)
- `consumption_entries.commitment_id` points to the source student's commitment being consumed
- Cross-student linkage uses shared `transfer_ref` on both rows
- `consumption_entries.lesson_participant_id` is optional for transfer flows (required for lesson flows)
- Audit data remains in `metadata` (reason, operator, context)

Transfer policy:

Supports moving balance between packages (allocation change) and between sibling students,
with mandatory audit trail and reason.

8. Waiting List

9. Instructor & Payroll System

services they can provide

working_days

max_students (per service)

break_time (optional)

9.2 Earnings (Automated)

Hourly/global workers via WorkSessions (legacy kept)

15. What We Still Needed (Final Review)
After re-scanning everything we discussed + typical real-world clinic SaaS, here are possible gaps:

✔ 1. Multi-service per student per week
Covered, but added: Service mix support

✔ 2. Partial attendance
Important in group lessons:

student_attended (boolean)

students_count per instance

✔ 3. Session capacity
We added “max_students per service”. Correct.

✔ 4. Instructor replacements
Covered but now explicitly required in UI.

✔ 5. Holidays & closed days
Added as system setting.

✔ 6. Documentation guidelines per service
Future: Templates for documentation.

✔ 7. Risk flags lifecycle
Added: “reviewed_by” field for clinician.

✔ 8. Multi-guardian communications
Supported now.

✔ 9. Staff permissions per service
Instructors should ONLY see students assigned to them.
Already covered under permissions but made explicit.

✔ 10. Object versioning
Lesson Template version history — added.

✔ 11. Business analytics (future)
Not MVP.

✔ 12. Sync between payroll & lessons
Covered fully.

✔ 13. Exceptions & overrides
Yes: per instance and per student.

✔ 14. Export API for future mobile app
Not MVP, but DB designed to support it.

✔ 15. Support for adult students (self-guardian)
Added.
